AGENTS:

LLM Agent:
-  We need to check if the LLM is making valid moves. Check their move against the list of valid moves (from )




Plot fix plan:

1. Bluff Timing Plot: The concept behind this was relying on the average number of dice remaining when bluffing. 
   However, in this variation of the game, we lose lives, not dice, when bluffing. So we always have 5 dice. 
   We should instead track the number (quantity) of dice called in the previous round that caused this agent to bluff,
   so we can see patterns in bluff timing. And/Or any other relevant metrics you can think of!

2. Bluffing Behavior Plot: If it is easy to do, let's track the number of failed bluff calls per round as well.

3. Individual performance metrics: 
   - It seems like we are not properly tracking the failed bluff calls, for the RandomAgent as this
    value is always zero.
    - Let's plot the wins as an average, not a total.

4. win rates plot: This is not properly aggregating the win rates by agent type. For example in the control_4random
   test, we should see that the win rate is 100% for the RandomAgent, but we see 25%. 

5. LLM Reasononing Plot: This is SO cool, however, the output of the LLM is stochastic, so we need a way
of grouping together similar reasonings. 
Ideas:
 -  Creaete embeddings for the reasoning output
 -  Use cosine similarity to group together similar reasonings.
 -  Not sure if a clustering algorithm like k-means would work, but it's a good idea to try. 
 -  Once we group together similar reasonings, we can take a random sample from each group and have an LLM summarize
    them in to genearal 'decision types', which we can then use for our charts.
