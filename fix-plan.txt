1. Bluffing Behavior Plot
   a. Let's please annotat the Call Bluff Rate as a Percentage! The annotation above the
      bar should be 20%, not 0.2 for example.

2. Bid_patterns and Bid_Behavior plots.
   a. The value labels are being overlapped by the vertical std deviation bars. Usually it splits
      and covers up the decimal point of the annotation. Maybe there is an easy way to adjust this
      to the left or right such that the annotation wont get overlapped.

3. Individual Agent Metrics Plot
   a. The Total Wins needs to be a percentage of total games won, not the count of games won!
      The reason for this is that for simulations of thousands of games, the total Wins bars are
      huge and then the other metrics get lost. 

4. Survival Time Plot.
   a. Somehow, this plot is showing that the survival time for Agents is a negative number!
      Obviously this makes no sense since each agent will survive at least one round no matter what.
      Not sure what happened here, but this plot has lost all of it's meaninful value.
