Baseline Tests
Control tests to establish baseline performance
Shows what "random" and "informed" baselines look like

Probability vs Random
Directly tests your hypothesis about probability-based decisions
1v3 and 2v2 configurations to test different scenarios

Adaptive Intelligence
Tests if adaptive learning can outperform pure probability
Includes challenging scenarios against informed agents

LLM (Human-like) Performance
Tests your "human proxy" against other strategies
Uses fewer rounds due to API constraints

Mixed Environment Tests
Tests all agent types together
Helps establish a hierarchy of effectiveness

Long-Term Learning
Extended tests to analyze learning depth
Focus on adaptive agent improvement over time
